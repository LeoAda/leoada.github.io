# :compass:A learning journey (in AI and Data)

Having freshly graduated with an engineering degree specialized in big data, I continue to work at the company where I completed my last year of apprenticeship. I'm now in the position of a Data Science/AI engineer and continue to work on projects like being in charge of building the company's data platform. I have worked on a project using machine learning (ML), another using large language models (LLMs), and some dashboards. You can understand that my tasks cover quite a lot of different fields across the spectrum of data and AI.
</br>
Now I'm on the verge of deploying into production the data platform that will ease use for data analysis and production of datasets; in other words, I will more focus on AI projects.
</br>
I have knowledge in ML, LLMs, and data under my belt, and also, through my studies, a strong mathematics base. It's understandable that due to my short experience and the nature of my studies, I lack a *fundamental* understanding of AI from start to finish, even aside from curiosity and side projects with on-the-job training. To adress this problem, I asked myself :
</br>
***Which existing skills should I improve, which new skills should I acquire next, and how should I do so ?***

## :package:First step: Inventory of knowledge and skills 

>"*If it ain't broke, don't fix it*"

Since you probably aren't starting from scratch, you have some knowledge and skills. In order to avoid wasting time in your learning journey, it's a good idea to list what you know, how much you master it, and how interested you are in it. Indeed, if you don't like something, you will struggle to develop it, even when in some cases it's mandatory to master a skill in order to learn more about another.
</br>
A simple tool is the **skills matrix**. The principle is simple: you list your knowledge and skills in lines. You can put them in categories to make things easier to read.
</br>
In the columns, include a **self-assessment score** you estimate for this skill/knowledge. I emphasize the **self**-assessment feature because of some psychological effects that cause overestimation or underestimation of your competencies. To name a few, the *Illusory Superiority* and the *Imposter Syndrome*. To cope with these effects, it's always a good idea to take **assessment tests** with a final score that you can compare to your estimated score.
</br>
Then, on the same principle, a column with a **score of interest**. Of course, it's essential to be interested in what you will learn; sometimes there are required basics to go further, but if you deeply hate something, it may not be the right way, or you can use shortcuts to avoid going too much into these.
</br>
For the rest of the article, I will focus on theoretical knowledge and not practical skills that deserve their own article.

## :thinking:Second step: What should you learn?

>"*There are unknown unknowns*"

You can deduce from this expression that it can be challenging to plan your learning path in a domain that is unknown to you.
I propose you two methods to address this problem.

1. "*Think big, start small*"
Begin by listing the most general words you could think of in your domain. Then you will proceed to break the domain into multiple components, for example:
You start from machine learning, which can be separated into supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and so on.
From supervised learning, you can separate it into classification, regression, etc.
Do that until satisfaction. Drawing it in the form of a mind map or tree can be better to let your mind go.

2. "*Those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it*"
Another approach is to start from a goal you like and search for what information or inspiration it took. With this method, you will construct some kind of historical chronology of concepts.
For example: Start from LLMs, you will begin with the GPT paper, then you will see "Attention is All You Need," then the encoder/decoder models, then LSTM, etc.
It's a good way to learn the path that led to the technologies we use today.
</br>

:information_source: I highly suggest you use **Wikipedia** as a database for your research for both methods because it regularly adds historical and component parts to pages that allow you to go deeper and deeper.

## :racing_car:Final step: Begin to learn
Maybe the most important step, **you must start to learn**; indeed, the main thing to do is start somewhere and keep moving forward.
Yes, your map is not perfect. Yes, you hesitate which way is the most time-efficient.
All of this doesn't matter from the moment you start and don't stop.
In psychology, the brain doesn't form habits by waiting for the **perfect opportunity**; it takes them **by doing**, even if it's a small step.
