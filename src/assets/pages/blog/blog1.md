# Why a learning journey ?

Freshly graduated from an engineering degree specialized in big data, I continue to work in the company where I made my last year in apprenticeship. I’m in the position of Data Science/AI engineer and I continue to work on projects like being in charge of building the company data platform. I used to work on a project using ML, another using LLM and some dashboards. You can understand that my tasks are on quite a lot of different fields on the spectrum of data and AI.

Now I’m on the verge of deploying in production the data platform that will ease use for data analysis and production of dataset, in other words, I will work on AI projects.

I have an MVP with ML and LLM under my belt, also by my studies, a strong mathematics base. It’s understandable, due to my short experience and the nature of studies, I lack a fundamental understanding from start to finish of AI. Even beside curiosity and side projects with on-the-job training. Now:

Which existing skills should I improve, which new skills should I acquire next, and how to do so ?

First step: inventory of knowledge and skills
If it ain't broke, don't fix it : You probably aren't a newborn, so you have some knowledge and skills. In order to avoid wasting times in you learning journey, it's a good idea to list what you know, how much you master it, and it could be interesting how much you are interested by this. Indeed, if you didn't like something you will have some struggle to develop it. Even when in some case it's mandatory to master a skill in order to learn more about another.
A simple tool is the "skills matrix", 
Skills matrix :
skills/competencies level and interests
Use assesment test after self evaluation to avoid Better-than-average effect/Illusory superiority

Second step: What should you learn
There are unknown unknowns
Sometimes you know that you know nothing but sometimes you don't know you know nothing

Third step: How to structure learning

but that a story for an other day
