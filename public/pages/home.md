Hi, I'm Léo !

I'm a Data Science and AI Engineer with a passion for exploring various scientific and technological fields. Currently, I work at [Maxxing](https://maxxing.com/en/) where I develop and deploy machine learning models, as well as design and implement the data infrastructure.

In my free time, I'm constantly driven by curiosity to expand my knowledge. I enjoy reading scientific papers and books across diverse domains, including computer science, artificial intelligence, ecology, chemistry, and even philosophy.

Beyond writing Python scripts, I also enjoy writing articles about my readings, reflections, and projects. Sharing knowledge is important to me, and I hope you'll find something insightful here.

I'm always open to discussions! Feel free to connect with me on [<i class="fa-brands fa-linkedin"></i>](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-ada/).
